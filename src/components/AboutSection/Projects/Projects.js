     As I said, I like working on different projects, in C++ I couldn't design my demo projects and it looked not so good,
     but I do know those projects really helped me understand Programming more and improved my skills  </p>
    <p className="hero-text">  In React, there are a lot of built-in tools for desinging and adding cool features in my Website.
     I think Algorithm is my place, while working as a React js Developer, I will continue learning Algorithm in C++.
